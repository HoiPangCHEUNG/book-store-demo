# Book Store Demo

This is me randomly playing around with Next.js with Radix UI, Tailwind CSS and Typescript. I have crafted a simple book list component which allow users perform basic CRUD operations on a list of books.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
